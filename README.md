# SerialtoEthernet

The purpose of this project is to enhance the capabilities of serial driven automation storage system by allowing it to be controlled via a network. Modern computer retailers do not prioritise serial devices connectivity. Although, serial ports are still in use and more common in many industrial applications. Serial communication typically requires a wire, point to point cable connection, and it is limited by the length of the cable. To access a serial application on multiple devices will require separate RS232 cable and available ports. To overcome these factors a serial via network software will allow serial communication over LAN, this will share com ports over the network and connect to remote serial devices, in simple terms a protocol converter. Protocol Converter is a device used to convert standard or proprietary protocol of one device to the protocol suitable for the other device or tools to achieve the interoperability.


### TECHNICAL SPECIFICATION
In the process of developing a reliable and dynamic software, different technologies are used. These are as follows,

- Languages – Java-FX
- IDE – Eclipse • JSerialComm

The software “Serial via Network” is a desktop application, which is created by using JavaFX which is a software platform for creating and delivering desktop applications. Eclipse is one of the finest backend and front-end builder available in the market with ease of use and make the application to give a look of its profession.

### USE-CASE DIAGRAM
To describe the model of a system’s dynamic behaviour is most important. Use case diagram consists of actors, use cases and relationships. The actors consist of internal and external agents. From the use case diagram, we can gather the system requirements. The factors which effect the internal and external features of the system can be obtained.
